Lab 0 for CS100, Fall 2019
My website is focussed all about me. It has fun facts and information about my family as well. Organizationally, my website was structured in a specific way. The first page has all of my bootsrapping design. This includes alerts, grids, columns of more than two on the grid etc. The second and third pages have all of my own css established work. Page 3 has my photo, as well as a button that reveals my favorite color when clicked (blue).

While my website is not perfect, I am pretty proud of how much I learned in the last two days to accomplish it. I haven't coded in HTML in a very long time, and I have never seen git or github before, so one could easily imagine the frustration of getting git to work.

I know that on future assignments, I will have to spend more time on more detailed work, but in the meantime... I am very happy with myself.
